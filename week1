Respected Sir,

In this week the work that has been done is given as follows :

-> For detecting any object in an GIS image I have to create a model which can
detect  the object. Initially I am beginning with water body detection in a
google satellite images.

-> The first challenge I faced is the scarcity of labeled data for training a
model. I figured out a way to label the images whether a water body is present
in the image or not.

-> First I downloaded the "normal" google map of a specific cor-ordinate at a
specific zoom level. I observed that the water bodies in this kind of map has
a fix RGB value, which is R=163, G=204, and B=255. I converted RGB values to
HSV value and defined an upper and lower bound for detecting that color. I used
opencv module in Python 3.5 to perform the above stated task.

-> After converting the "normal" google map of the place into binary image where
only water bodies are visible and other things are blacked out. *image*

-> Now there are some noise in the image like some individual pixels also have that same RGB values.
So I normalized the image. *image*

-> Now I wrote a logic that if an image contains white pixel then obviously it
contains waterbody and so thus it's satellite counterpart also has some water waterbody
present int it. And by using this logic I labeled the images and created a data
set of 456 images.

The accuracy of the training set is :
