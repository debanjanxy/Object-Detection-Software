    Object detection deals with the detection of a specific class of object in satellite images. It has ample amount of applications in the field of military surveillance, city planning and region surveillance. However, there exists some challenges in this field, such as scarcity of data for a specific object of interest, quality of the images etc. In this survey, we will first discuss about the object localization algorithms for localizing the object of interest. These algorithms will output some potential windows which might contain the object. Then we will illuminate on the deep learning methods that can be used to successfully recognize the object from the proposed windows. We have also implemented some of the methods to detect wells in the satellite images of Maharashtra.
