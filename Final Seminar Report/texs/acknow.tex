I would like to express my special thanks and gratitude to my guide \textbf{Prof. Om P. Damani} who guided me and provided me with necessary materials to start on the topic named as ``Object Detection in Satellite Images". I would also like to thank the instructors of the courses \textbf{CS 621, EE 769} which provided me a clear understanding of machine learning techniques.
